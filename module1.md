### **Understanding Artificial Intelligence**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) delves into the realm of computer science with the aim of mimicking aspects of human intellect. This includes capabilities such as learning, deciphering patterns, problem-solving, and comprehending language. Today, we encounter AI functionalities in numerous everyday tools like smart voice assistants, tailored content suggestions, and self-driving vehicles.

In recent times, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) by entities such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Baidu, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, has brought AI-driven chat interfaces to the forefront for everyday users.

### **What Exactly is an AI Model?**

An AI model can be visualized as a mathematical analogy of processes we observe in the real world. To exemplify, models dedicated to language are designed to produce text that mimics human communication, dependent on the input they receive. There are also other models that specialize in dealing with various tasks, such as video processing, image generating, playing chess, etc.

### **Delving into the World of Large Language Models (LLMs)**

LLMs, exemplified by creations like OpenAI's GPT-4, stand as a distinct category of AI models. Their primary function? Utilizing machine learning techniques to craft text that mirrors human communication. Though they're trained using an array of online text sources, they remain unaware of the specific content in their training set and cannot tap into private or classified data unless it's directly shared during an interaction.

### **How LLMs Works?**

At their core, LLMs operate by estimating the likelihood of a subsequent word (or "token" as we'll dive into later) relying on prior words in a statement.

For example:

The LLM will calculate the likelihood of these words and output the most possible one, like books.

This mechanism ensures the production of contextually relevant and fluent sentences. Nonetheless, it's pivotal to understand that, unlike humans, LLMs lack genuine comprehension of content and don't possess the ability to think or be aware autonomously.

In our case, SmartPrep's foundation models are tailored for dealing with educational tasks and aligned with educators' and students' needs.

### **LLMs In The Future**

Though LLMs stand for Large Language Models now, they are iterating very quickly and have started to gain abilities other than purely generating text. For example, a majority of AI companies are working on multimodal models, which can be used to process data other than text forms like images, audio, video, etc. One thing to keep in mind is that though LLMs have great comprehension and inference abilities, there is no evidence till now to show that LLMs are self-aware.

### **Conclusion**

In wrapping up the inaugural module of your instructional journey, we've navigated through AI's rudimentary concepts, clarified the nature of an AI model, ventured into the intricacies of Large Language Models (LLMs), and underscored the critical role of foundational models. As we progress into subsequent modules, we'll delve deeper into the more nuanced and specialized facets of AI and linguistic models.
